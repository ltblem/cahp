# Cahp - A random sentance generator

Cahp generates a random phrase, styled a bit like a news article. It also randomly generates an author and date, and sometimes it'll give you a `tip`, or maybe even a `cat`!

## Configuration

If you'd like to customise how Cahp is configured, you can modify the `config.nim` file before compilation.

## Installation

You can either download a pre-built binary from the Releases page, or you can build your own by installing Nim and running `build.sh`.
