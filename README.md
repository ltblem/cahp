# Cahp - A random sentance generator

Cahp generates a random phrase, styled a bit like a news article. It also randomly generates an author and date, and sometimes it'll give you a `tip`.

## Installation

You can either download a pre-built binary from the Releases page, or you can build your own by installing Nim and running `install.sh`.
